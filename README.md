## Ansible Linux hardening

This project aims to automate Linux hardening with a set of Ansible roles. 

Current roles:
- `users`
  - Automates secure user setup: ensures only specified users exist, set proper privilges and privilege groups, enforces password complexity rules, configures brute-force password protection, and more.
  - The initial setup for this role is described in my Medium story, [here](https://medium.com/@0xtr1gger/ansible-roles-everything-you-need-to-know-d58599e38f33). You can read it even if you don't have Medium subscription, since I provide a friend link at the very beginning of the article that allows anyone to read my work without restrictions.
